241. ### What is an Unary operator

     The unary(+) operator is used to convert a variable to a number.If the variable cannot be converted, it will still become a number but with the value NaN. Let's see this behavior in an action.

     ```javascript
     var x = "100";
     var y = +x;
     console.log(typeof x, typeof y); // string, number

     var a = "Hello";
     var b = +a;
     console.log(typeof a, typeof b, b); // string, number, NaN
     ```

242. ### How do you sort elements in an array

     The sort() method is used to sort the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array. The example usage would be as below,

     ```javascript
     var months = ["Aug", "Sep", "Jan", "June"];
     months.sort();
     console.log(months); //  ["Aug", "Jan", "June", "Sep"]
     ```

243. ### What is the purpose of compareFunction while sorting arrays

     The compareFunction is used to define the sort order. If omitted, the array elements are converted to strings, then sorted according to each character's Unicode code point value. Let's take an example to see the usage of compareFunction,

     ```javascript
     let numbers = [1, 2, 5, 3, 4];
     numbers.sort((a, b) => b - a);
     console.log(numbers); // [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
     ```

244. ### How do you reversing an array

     You can use the reverse() method to reverse the elements in an array. This method is useful to sort an array in descending order. Let's see the usage of reverse() method in an example,

     ```javascript
     let numbers = [1, 2, 5, 3, 4];
     numbers.sort((a, b) => b - a);
     numbers.reverse();
     console.log(numbers); // [1, 2, 3, 4 ,5]
     ```

245. ### How do you find min and max value in an array

     You can use `Math.min` and `Math.max` methods on array variables to find the minimum and maximum elements within an array. Let's create two functions to find the min and max value with in an array,

     ```javascript
     var marks = [50, 20, 70, 60, 45, 30];
     function findMin(arr) {
       return Math.min.apply(null, arr);
     }
     function findMax(arr) {
       return Math.max.apply(null, arr);
     }

     console.log(findMin(marks));
     console.log(findMax(marks));
     ```

246. ### How do you find min and max values without Math functions

     You can write functions which loop through an array comparing each value with the lowest value or highest value to find the min and max values. Let's create those functions to find min and max values,

     ```javascript
     var marks = [50, 20, 70, 60, 45, 30];
     function findMin(arr) {
       var length = arr.length;
       var min = Infinity;
       while (length--) {
         if (arr[length] < min) {
           min = arr[length];
         }
       }
       return min;
     }

     function findMax(arr) {
       var length = arr.length;
       var max = -Infinity;
       while (length--) {
         if (arr[length] > max) {
           max = arr[length];
         }
       }
       return max;
     }

     console.log(findMin(marks));
     console.log(findMax(marks));
     ```

247. ### What is an empty statement and purpose of it

     The empty statement is a semicolon (;) indicating that no statement will be executed, even if JavaScript syntax requires one. Since there is no action with an empty statement you might think that it's usage is quite less, but the empty statement is occasionally useful when you want to create a loop that has an empty body. For example, you can initialize an array with zero values as below,

     ```javascript
     // Initialize an array a
     for(let i=0; i < a.length; a[i++] = 0) ;
     ```

248. ### How do you get metadata of a module

     You can use the `import.meta` object which is a meta-property exposing context-specific meta data to a JavaScript module. It contains information about the current module, such as the module's URL. In browsers, you might get different meta data than NodeJS.

     ```javascript
     <script type="module" src="welcome-module.js"></script>;
     console.log(import.meta); // { url: "file:///home/user/welcome-module.js" }
     ```

249. ### What is a comma operator

     The comma operator is used to evaluate each of its operands from left to right and returns the value of the last operand. This is totally different from comma usage within arrays, objects, and function arguments and parameters. For example, the usage for numeric expressions would be as below,

     ```javascript
     var x = 1;
     x = (x++, x);

     console.log(x); // 2
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

250. ### What is the advantage of a comma operator

     It is normally used to include multiple expressions in a location that requires a single expression. One of the common usages of this comma operator is to supply multiple parameters in a `for` loop. For example, the below for loop uses multiple expressions in a single location using comma operator,

     ```javascript
     for (var a = 0, b =10; a <= 10; a++, b--)
     ```

     You can also use the comma operator in a return statement where it processes before returning.

     ```javascript
     function myFunction() {
       var a = 1;
       return (a += 10), a; // 11
     }
     ```

251. ### What is typescript

     TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript created by Microsoft that adds optional types, classes, async/await, and many other features, and compiles to plain JavaScript. Angular built entirely in TypeScript and used as a primary language. You can install it globally as

     ```bash
     npm install -g typescript
     ```

     Let's see a simple example of TypeScript usage,

     ```typescript
     function greeting(name: string): string {
       return "Hello, " + name;
     }

     let user = "Sudheer";

     console.log(greeting(user));
     ```

     The greeting method allows only string type as argument.

252. ### What are the differences between javascript and typescript

     Below are the list of differences between javascript and typescript,

     | feature             | typescript                            | javascript                                      |
     | ------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
     | Language paradigm   | Object oriented programming language  | Scripting language                              |
     | Typing support      | Supports static typing                | It has dynamic typing                           |
     | Modules             | Supported                             | Not supported                                   |
     | Interface           | It has interfaces concept             | Doesn't support interfaces                      |
     | Optional parameters | Functions support optional parameters | No support of optional parameters for functions |

253. ### What are the advantages of typescript over javascript

     Below are some of the advantages of typescript over javascript,

     1. TypeScript is able to find compile time errors at the development time only and it makes sures less runtime errors. Whereas javascript is an interpreted language.
     2. TypeScript is strongly-typed or supports static typing which allows for checking type correctness at compile time. This is not available in javascript.
     3. TypeScript compiler can compile the .ts files into ES3,ES4 and ES5 unlike ES6 features of javascript which may not be supported in some browsers.

254. ### What is an object initializer

     An object initializer is an expression that describes the initialization of an Object. The syntax for this expression is represented as a comma-delimited list of zero or more pairs of property names and associated values of an object, enclosed in curly braces ({}). This is also known as literal notation. It is one of the ways to create an object.

     ```javascript
     var initObject = { a: "John", b: 50, c: {} };

     console.log(initObject.a); // John
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

255. ### What is a constructor method

     The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created within a class. If you do not specify a constructor method, a default constructor is used. The example usage of constructor would be as below,

     ```javascript
     class Employee {
       constructor() {
         this.name = "John";
       }
     }

     var employeeObject = new Employee();

     console.log(employeeObject.name); // John
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

256. ### What happens if you write constructor more than once in a class

     The "constructor" in a class is a special method and it should be defined only once in a class. i.e, If you write a constructor method more than once in a class it will throw a `SyntaxError` error.

     ```javascript
      class Employee {
        constructor() {
          this.name = "John";
        }
        constructor() {   //  Uncaught SyntaxError: A class may only have one constructor
          this.age = 30;
        }
      }

      var employeeObject = new Employee();

      console.log(employeeObject.name);
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

257. ### How do you call the constructor of a parent class

     You can use the `super` keyword to call the constructor of a parent class. Remember that `super()` must be called before using 'this' reference. Otherwise it will cause a reference error. Let's the usage of it,

     ```javascript
     class Square extends Rectangle {
       constructor(length) {
         super(length, length);
         this.name = "Square";
       }

       get area() {
         return this.width * this.height;
       }

       set area(value) {
         this.area = value;
       }
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

258. ### How do you get the prototype of an object

     You can use the `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)` method to return the prototype of the specified object. i.e. The value of the internal `prototype` property. If there are no inherited properties then `null` value is returned.

     ```javascript
     const newPrototype = {};
     const newObject = Object.create(newPrototype);

     console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(newObject) === newPrototype); // true
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

259. ### What happens If I pass string type for getPrototype method

     In ES5, it will throw a TypeError exception if the obj parameter isn't an object. Whereas in ES2015, the parameter will be coerced to an `Object`.

     ```javascript
     // ES5
     Object.getPrototypeOf("James"); // TypeError: "James" is not an object
     // ES2015
     Object.getPrototypeOf("James"); // String.prototype
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

260. ### How do you set prototype of one object to another

     You can use the `Object.setPrototypeOf()` method that sets the prototype (i.e., the internal `Prototype` property) of a specified object to another object or null. For example, if you want to set prototype of a square object to rectangle object would be as follows,

     ```javascript
     Object.setPrototypeOf(Square.prototype, Rectangle.prototype);
     Object.setPrototypeOf({}, null);
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

261. ### How do you check whether an object can be extendable or not

     The `Object.isExtensible()` method is used to determine if an object is extendable or not. i.e, Whether it can have new properties added to it or not.

     ```javascript
     const newObject = {};
     console.log(Object.isExtensible(newObject)); //true
     ```

     **Note:** By default, all the objects are extendable. i.e, The new properties can be added or modified.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

262. ### How do you prevent an object to extend

     The `Object.preventExtensions()` method is used to prevent new properties from ever being added to an object. In other words, it prevents future extensions to the object. Let's see the usage of this property,

     ```javascript
     const newObject = {};
     Object.preventExtensions(newObject); // NOT extendable

     try {
       Object.defineProperty(newObject, "newProperty", {
         // Adding new property
         value: 100,
       });
     } catch (e) {
       console.log(e); // TypeError: Cannot define property newProperty, object is not extensible
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

263. ### What are the different ways to make an object non-extensible

     You can mark an object non-extensible in 3 ways,

     1. Object.preventExtensions
     2. Object.seal
     3. Object.freeze

     ```javascript
     var newObject = {};

     Object.preventExtensions(newObject); // Prevent objects are non-extensible
     Object.isExtensible(newObject); // false

     var sealedObject = Object.seal({}); // Sealed objects are non-extensible
     Object.isExtensible(sealedObject); // false

     var frozenObject = Object.freeze({}); // Frozen objects are non-extensible
     Object.isExtensible(frozenObject); // false
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

264. ### How do you define multiple properties on an object

     The `Object.defineProperties()` method is used to define new or modify existing properties directly on an object and returning the object. Let's define multiple properties on an empty object,

     ```javascript
     const newObject = {};

     Object.defineProperties(newObject, {
       newProperty1: {
         value: "John",
         writable: true,
       },
       newProperty2: {},
     });
     ```

265. ### What is MEAN in javascript

     The MEAN (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js) stack is the most popular open-source JavaScript software tech stack available for building dynamic web apps where you can write both the server-side and client-side halves of the web project entirely in JavaScript.

266. ### What Is Obfuscation in javascript

     Obfuscation is the deliberate act of creating obfuscated javascript code(i.e, source or machine code) that is difficult for humans to understand. It is something similar to encryption, but a machine can understand the code and execute it.
     Let's see the below function before Obfuscation,

     ```javascript
     function greeting() {
       console.log("Hello, welcome to JS world");
     }
     ```

     And after the code Obfuscation, it would be appeared as below,

     ```javascript
     eval(
       (function (p, a, c, k, e, d) {
         e = function (c) {
           return c;
         };
         if (!"".replace(/^/, String)) {
           while (c--) {
             d[c] = k[c] || c;
           }
           k = [
             function (e) {
               return d[e];
             },
           ];
           e = function () {
             return "\\w+";
           };
           c = 1;
         }
         while (c--) {
           if (k[c]) {
             p = p.replace(new RegExp("\\b" + e(c) + "\\b", "g"), k[c]);
           }
         }
         return p;
       })(
         "2 1(){0.3('4, 7 6 5 8')}",
         9,
         9,
         "console|greeting|function|log|Hello|JS|to|welcome|world".split("|"),
         0,
         {}
       )
     );
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

267. ### Why do you need Obfuscation

     Below are the few reasons for Obfuscation,

     1. The Code size will be reduced. So data transfers between server and client will be fast.
     2. It hides the business logic from outside world and protects the code from others
     3. Reverse engineering is highly difficult
     4. The download time will be reduced

268. ### What is Minification

     Minification is the process of removing all unnecessary characters(empty spaces are removed) and variables will be renamed without changing it's functionality. It is also a type of obfuscation .

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

269. ### What are the advantages of minification

     Normally it is recommended to use minification for heavy traffic and intensive requirements of resources. It reduces file sizes with below benefits,

     1. Decreases loading times of a web page
     2. Saves bandwidth usages

270. ### What are the differences between Obfuscation and Encryption

     Below are the main differences between Obfuscation and Encryption,

     | Feature            | Obfuscation                                     | Encryption                                                              |
     | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
     | Definition         | Changing the form of any data in any other form | Changing the form of information to an unreadable format by using a key |
     | A key to decode    | It can be decoded without any key               | It is required                                                          |
     | Target data format | It will be converted to a complex form          | Converted into an unreadable format                                     |

271. ### What are the common tools used for minification

     There are many online/offline tools to minify the javascript files,

     1. Google's Closure Compiler
     2. UglifyJS2
     3. jsmin
     4. javascript-minifier.com/
     5. prettydiff.com

272. ### How do you perform form validation using javascript

     JavaScript can be used to perform HTML form validation. For example, if the form field is empty, the function needs to notify, and return false, to prevent the form being submitted.
     Lets' perform user login in an html form,

     ```html
     <form name="myForm" onsubmit="return validateForm()" method="post">
       User name: <input type="text" name="uname" />
       <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
     </form>
     ```

     And the validation on user login is below,

     ```javascript
     function validateForm() {
       var x = document.forms["myForm"]["uname"].value;
       if (x == "") {
         alert("The username shouldn't be empty");
         return false;
       }
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

273. ### How do you perform form validation without javascript

     You can perform HTML form validation automatically without using javascript. The validation enabled by applying the `required` attribute to prevent form submission when the input is empty.

     ```html
     <form method="post">
       <input type="text" name="uname" required />
       <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
     </form>
     ```

     **Note:** Automatic form validation does not work in Internet Explorer 9 or earlier.

274. ### What are the DOM methods available for constraint validation

     The below DOM methods are available for constraint validation on an invalid input,

     1. checkValidity(): It returns true if an input element contains valid data.
     2. setCustomValidity(): It is used to set the validationMessage property of an input element.
        Let's take an user login form with DOM validations

     ```javascript
     function myFunction() {
       var userName = document.getElementById("uname");
       if (!userName.checkValidity()) {
         document.getElementById("message").innerHTML =
           userName.validationMessage;
       } else {
         document.getElementById("message").innerHTML =
           "Entered a valid username";
       }
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

275. ### What are the available constraint validation DOM properties

     Below are the list of some of the constraint validation DOM properties available,

     1. validity: It provides a list of boolean properties related to the validity of an input element.
     2. validationMessage: It displays the message when the validity is false.
     3. willValidate: It indicates if an input element will be validated or not.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

276. ### What are the list of validity properties

     The validity property of an input element provides a set of properties related to the validity of data.

     1. customError: It returns true, if a custom validity message is set.
     2. patternMismatch: It returns true, if an element's value does not match its pattern attribute.
     3. rangeOverflow: It returns true, if an element's value is greater than its max attribute.
     4. rangeUnderflow: It returns true, if an element's value is less than its min attribute.
     5. stepMismatch: It returns true, if an element's value is invalid according to step attribute.
     6. tooLong: It returns true, if an element's value exceeds its maxLength attribute.
     7. typeMismatch: It returns true, if an element's value is invalid according to type attribute.
     8. valueMissing: It returns true, if an element with a required attribute has no value.
     9. valid: It returns true, if an element's value is valid.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

277. ### Give an example usage of rangeOverflow property

     If an element's value is greater than its max attribute then rangeOverflow property returns true. For example, the below form submission throws an error if the value is more than 100,

     ```html
     <input id="age" type="number" max="100" />
     <button onclick="myOverflowFunction()">OK</button>
     ```

     ```javascript
     function myOverflowFunction() {
       if (document.getElementById("age").validity.rangeOverflow) {
         alert("The mentioned age is not allowed");
       }
     }
     ```

278. ### Is enums feature available in javascript

     No, javascript does not natively support enums. But there are different kinds of solutions to simulate them even though they may not provide exact equivalents. For example, you can use freeze or seal on object,

     ```javascript
     var DaysEnum = Object.freeze({"monday":1, "tuesday":2, "wednesday":3, ...})
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

279. ### What is an enum

     An enum is a type restricting variables to one value from a predefined set of constants. JavaScript has no enums but typescript provides built-in enum support.

     ```javascript
     enum Color {
      RED, GREEN, BLUE
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

280. ### How do you list all properties of an object

     You can use the `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` method which returns an array of all properties found directly in a given object. Let's the usage of it in an example,

     ```javascript
     const newObject = {
       a: 1,
       b: 2,
       c: 3,
     };

     console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(newObject));
     ["a", "b", "c"];
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

281. ### How do you get property descriptors of an object

     You can use the `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors()` method which returns all own property descriptors of a given object. The example usage of this method is below,

     ```javascript
     const newObject = {
       a: 1,
       b: 2,
       c: 3,
     };
     const descriptorsObject = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(newObject);
     console.log(descriptorsObject.a.writable); //true
     console.log(descriptorsObject.a.configurable); //true
     console.log(descriptorsObject.a.enumerable); //true
     console.log(descriptorsObject.a.value); // 1
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

282. ### What are the attributes provided by a property descriptor

     A property descriptor is a record which has the following attributes

     1. value: The value associated with the property
     2. writable: Determines whether the value associated with the property can be changed or not
     3. configurable: Returns true if the type of this property descriptor can be changed and if the property can be deleted from the corresponding object.
     4. enumerable: Determines whether the property appears during enumeration of the properties on the corresponding object or not.
     5. set: A function which serves as a setter for the property
     6. get: A function which serves as a getter for the property

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

283. ### How do you extend classes

     The `extends` keyword is used in class declarations/expressions to create a class which is a child of another class. It can be used to subclass custom classes as well as built-in objects. The syntax would be as below,

     ```javascript
     class ChildClass extends ParentClass { ... }
     ```

     Let's take an example of Square subclass from Polygon parent class,

     ```javascript
     class Square extends Rectangle {
       constructor(length) {
         super(length, length);
         this.name = "Square";
       }

       get area() {
         return this.width * this.height;
       }

       set area(value) {
         this.area = value;
       }
     }
     ```

284. ### How do I modify the url without reloading the page

     The `window.location.href` property will be helpful to modify the url but it reloads the page. HTML5 introduced the `history.pushState()` and `history.replaceState()` methods, which allow you to add and modify history entries, respectively. For example, you can use pushState as below,

     ```javascript
     window.history.pushState("page2", "Title", "/page2.html");
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

285. ### How do you check whether an array includes a particular value or not

     The `Array#includes()` method is used to determine whether an array includes a particular value among its entries by returning either true or false. Let's see an example to find an element(numeric and string) within an array.

     ```javascript
     var numericArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];
     console.log(numericArray.includes(3)); // true

     var stringArray = ["green", "yellow", "blue"];
     console.log(stringArray.includes("blue")); //true
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

286. ### How do you compare scalar arrays

     You can use length and every method of arrays to compare two scalar(compared directly using ===) arrays. The combination of these expressions can give the expected result,

     ```javascript
     const arrayFirst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
     const arraySecond = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
     console.log(
       arrayFirst.length === arraySecond.length &&
         arrayFirst.every((value, index) => value === arraySecond[index])
     ); // true
     ```

     If you would like to compare arrays irrespective of order then you should sort them before,

     ```javascript
     const arrayFirst = [2, 3, 1, 4, 5];
     const arraySecond = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
     console.log(
       arrayFirst.length === arraySecond.length &&
         arrayFirst.sort().every((value, index) => value === arraySecond[index])
     ); //true
     ```

287. ### How to get the value from get parameters

     The `new URL()` object accepts the url string and `searchParams` property of this object can be used to access the get parameters. Remember that you may need to use polyfill or `window.location` to access the URL in older browsers(including IE).

     ```javascript
     let urlString = "http://www.some-domain.com/about.html?x=1&y=2&z=3"; //window.location.href
     let url = new URL(urlString);
     let parameterZ = url.searchParams.get("z");
     console.log(parameterZ); // 3
     ```

288. ### How do you print numbers with commas as thousand separators

     You can use the `Number.prototype.toLocaleString()` method which returns a string with a language-sensitive representation such as thousand separator,currency etc of this number.

     ```javascript
     function convertToThousandFormat(x) {
       return x.toLocaleString(); // 12,345.679
     }

     console.log(convertToThousandFormat(12345.6789));
     ```

289. ### What is the difference between java and javascript

     Both are totally unrelated programming languages and no relation between them. Java is statically typed, compiled, runs on its own VM. Whereas Javascript is dynamically typed, interpreted, and runs in a browser and nodejs environments. Let's see the major differences in a tabular format,
     | Feature | Java | JavaScript |
     |---- | ---- | -----
     | Typed | It's a strongly typed language | It's a dynamic typed language |
     | Paradigm | Object oriented programming | Prototype based programming |
     | Scoping | Block scoped | Function-scoped |
     | Concurrency | Thread based | event based |
     | Memory | Uses more memory | Uses less memory. Hence it will be used for web pages |

290. ### Does JavaScript supports namespace

     JavaScript doesn’t support namespace by default. So if you create any element(function, method, object, variable) then it becomes global and pollutes the global namespace. Let's take an example of defining two functions without any namespace,

     ```javascript
     function func1() {
       console.log("This is a first definition");
     }
     function func1() {
       console.log("This is a second definition");
     }
     func1(); // This is a second definition
     ```

     It always calls the second function definition. In this case, namespace will solve the name collision problem.

291. ### How do you declare namespace

     Even though JavaScript lacks namespaces, we can use Objects , IIFE to create namespaces.

     1. **Using Object Literal Notation:** Let's wrap variables and functions inside an Object literal which acts as a namespace. After that you can access them using object notation

     ```javascript
     var namespaceOne = {
        function func1() {
            console.log("This is a first definition");
        }
     }
     var namespaceTwo = {
          function func1() {
              console.log("This is a second definition");
          }
      }
     namespaceOne.func1(); // This is a first definition
     namespaceTwo.func1(); // This is a second definition
     ```

     1. **Using IIFE (Immediately invoked function expression):** The outer pair of parentheses of IIFE creates a local scope for all the code inside of it and makes the anonymous function a function expression. Due to that, you can create the same function in two different function expressions to act as a namespace.

     ```javascript
     (function () {
       function fun1() {
         console.log("This is a first definition");
       }
       fun1();
     })();

     (function () {
       function fun1() {
         console.log("This is a second definition");
       }
       fun1();
     })();
     ```

     1. **Using a block and a let/const declaration:** In ECMAScript 6, you can simply use a block and a let declaration to restrict the scope of a variable to a block.

     ```javascript
     {
       let myFunction = function fun1() {
         console.log("This is a first definition");
       };
       myFunction();
     }
     //myFunction(): ReferenceError: myFunction is not defined.

     {
       let myFunction = function fun1() {
         console.log("This is a second definition");
       };
       myFunction();
     }
     //myFunction(): ReferenceError: myFunction is not defined.
     ```

292. ### How do you invoke javascript code in an iframe from parent page

     Initially iFrame needs to be accessed using either `document.getElementBy` or `window.frames`. After that `contentWindow` property of iFrame gives the access for targetFunction

     ```javascript
     document.getElementById("targetFrame").contentWindow.targetFunction();
     window.frames[0].frameElement.contentWindow.targetFunction(); // Accessing iframe this way may not work in latest versions chrome and firefox
     ```

293. ### How do get the timezone offset from date

     You can use the `getTimezoneOffset` method of the date object. This method returns the time zone difference, in minutes, from current locale (host system settings) to UTC

     ```javascript
     var offset = new Date().getTimezoneOffset();
     console.log(offset); // -480
     ```

294. ### How do you load CSS and JS files dynamically

     You can create both link and script elements in the DOM and append them as child to head tag. Let's create a function to add script and style resources as below,

     ```javascript
     function loadAssets(filename, filetype) {
       if (filetype == "css") {
         // External CSS file
         var fileReference = document.createElement("link");
         fileReference.setAttribute("rel", "stylesheet");
         fileReference.setAttribute("type", "text/css");
         fileReference.setAttribute("href", filename);
       } else if (filetype == "js") {
         // External JavaScript file
         var fileReference = document.createElement("script");
         fileReference.setAttribute("type", "text/javascript");
         fileReference.setAttribute("src", filename);
       }
       if (typeof fileReference != "undefined")
         document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(fileReference);
     }
     ```

295. ### What are the different methods to find HTML elements in DOM

     If you want to access any element in an HTML page, you need to start with accessing the document object. Later you can use any of the below methods to find the HTML element,

     1. document.getElementById(id): It finds an element by Id
     2. document.getElementsByTagName(name): It finds an element by tag name
     3. document.getElementsByClassName(name): It finds an element by class name

296. ### What is jQuery

     jQuery is a popular cross-browser JavaScript library that provides Document Object Model (DOM) traversal, event handling, animations and AJAX interactions by minimizing the discrepancies across browsers. It is widely famous with its philosophy of “Write less, do more”. For example, you can display welcome message on the page load using jQuery as below,

     ```javascript
     $(document).ready(function () {
       // It selects the document and apply the function on page load
       alert("Welcome to jQuery world");
     });
     ```

     **Note:** You can download it from jquery's official site or install it from CDNs, like google.

297. ### What is V8 JavaScript engine

     V8 is an open source high-performance JavaScript engine used by the Google Chrome browser, written in C++. It is also being used in the node.js project. It implements ECMAScript and WebAssembly, and runs on Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.12+, and Linux systems that use x64, IA-32, ARM, or MIPS processors.
     **Note:** It can run standalone, or can be embedded into any C++ application.

298. ### Why do we call javascript as dynamic language

     JavaScript is a loosely typed or a dynamic language because variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned/reassigned with values of all types.

     ```javascript
     let age = 50; // age is a number now
     age = "old"; // age is a string now
     age = true; // age is a boolean
     ```

299. ### What is a void operator

     The `void` operator evaluates the given expression and then returns undefined(i.e, without returning value). The syntax would be as below,

     ```javascript
     void expression;
     void expression;
     ```

     Let's display a message without any redirection or reload

     ```javascript
     <a href="javascript:void(alert('Welcome to JS world'))">
       Click here to see a message
     </a>
     ```

     **Note:** This operator is often used to obtain the undefined primitive value, using "void(0)".

300. ### How to set the cursor to wait

     The cursor can be set to wait in JavaScript by using the property "cursor". Let's perform this behavior on page load using the below function.

     ```javascript
     function myFunction() {
       window.document.body.style.cursor = "wait";
     }
     ```

     and this function invoked on page load

     ```html
     <body onload="myFunction()"></body>
     ```
